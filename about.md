## What Motivates Us

We are passionate about helping people make sense of data. Data permeates many
aspects of our lives today. Data scientists analyze data to provide
information for data-driven decisions or scientific discoveries. Informed
citizens use data to keep their representatives accountable. Machine learning
engineers use data to train models that help us take better pictures, suggest
people we may want to follow, or decides whether we get a loan. In our group,
we want to use our expertise in system building and design to help everyone
uncover insights in data and understand how data is used to make decisions
that affect their lives.
